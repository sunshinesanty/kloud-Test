# NgCars

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.5.5.

The back is in node using epxress server.
- The Backed express server is more of a proxy to read from the endpoint provided in the code test document. To address the CORS issue
- The server will be launched on http://localhost:3088 once built. (npm run build)

In develop mode (npm start), the backend server will run and auto update using NOdemon and front will be hosted by angular CLI on http://localhost:4200
